                Musical acts made up of attractive and talented young people have been a reliable recipe for success for decades.
                 One Direction reigned in 2010, the rivalries between Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera defined pop music in the ’90s, and New Kids On The Block was an ‘80s acid wash teen dream. But on November 19, 2017, the K-pop band BTS took to the AMA stage for their first-ever U.S. performance and shook the American music industry. 
                 BTS would go on to set the record for most Twitter engagements, grace the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine, record with Lil Nas X on Old Town Road (Seoul Town Road Remix), sing carpool Karaoke, and solidify their international stardom. 
                 The Korean Wave that started in the ‘80s finally crested over the United States. 
                 It’s been four years since BTS performed at the AMAs and burst into the American mainstream. 
                 But it would be a disservice to the genre to say that K-pop started when BTS burst on the scene.
